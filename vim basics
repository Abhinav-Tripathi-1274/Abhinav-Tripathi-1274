-vim basics-
/* use delete, yank, paste, etc. words in combination with jump words and all these can be combined with numbers */

--insert mode :- to enter in insert mode 
  with new line downwad = o
  with new line upward = shift + o
  with next character = a
  replace = r
  jump to next word = w
  jump full word even separated by hyphen = shift + w (W)
  back word jump = b 
  jump to end of a word = e
  jump to first word of line and shift to insert mode = shift + i (I)
  jump to end of a line = $ (dollar sign)
  jump to end of a line = 0
  jump before any special symbol = t symbol
  jump onto the special symbol = f symbol
  jump backward in front/ onto special symbol = shift t (T)/ shift f (F)
  jump to closing and opening bracket or to directly jump to opening bracket in which sentence lies = % (percentage sign)
  to delete everthing in parenthesis including them = d %
  jump to file beginning = gg
  jump to file end = shift + g (G)
  to leave = esc
  
--normal mode :- for commands

--visual mode :- for selecting
  to enter = v
  
  delete = d
  delete whole line = dd
  delete word after cursor = dw
  delete word before cursor = db
  delete in a word = diw
  delete up of the part of the cursor in the line = shift + d (C)
  delete(/precisely change line) whole line w/o vanishing that line and entering in the insert mode from any mode = cc
  delete up until the symbol = d t symbol
  change up of the cursor line = shift + c (C)
  change in word = ciw
  change in quotation marks = ci" (quotation mark) // similar for any parentheiesis
    
  copying (yanking) = y
  copying whole line = yy or upper arrow + y or shift + y (Y)
  
  paste = p
  paste in upper line = upper arrow + p (similar for down pasting)
  10 times pasting = 10p

undo = u
redo = ctrl + r

3 times undo = 3u
3 times redo = 3 + ctrl + r
